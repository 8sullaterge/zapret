# Xfinity Dvr Playback Not Working
 
 
I have isolated it to the following (having exhausted all browsers, settings, cables +). It works perfectly on my new macbook air m2, BUT when I add an extended monitor, that's when audio only, no video is experienced. I'm using the J5 Create docking station with HDMI ports.

MacOS 12.0 and above has a glitch in the way it caches websites. This is due to the newish "Continuity" features built into MacOS. The OS sees your other AirPlay devices (for example, iPad) and considers them as a second display or secondary audio output. With many streaming sites, multi-display, and multiple sound outputs are not allowed. So in the instance of Xfinity/Stream.com the site can't determine if there is a second display connected or not. Easiest fix that won't change your system settings or workflow is to delete the website data connected to Xfinity prior to trying to 'Watch TV Online' with a web browser. Deleting this data will force the site to reload and ask you to login again. Log-in and it should stream fine. (Until you connect to a second display or AirPlay device again.) A more permanent fix, If you don't use the continuity stuff, is to turn those options off in Settings>Displays>Advanced>Link to Mac or iPad.
 
I fixed my issue with Xfinity stream. I deleted the app from my iPad. Cleared cache/web history from Safari. Turn off the iPad, then back on and reinstalled the app. At sign-in, the correct sign-in website was shown, and I logged in without further issues.
 
Omar - Can you please reread the question and provide a solution? We are not having "app" problems. We are having problems streaming using our browsers on Mac. I have tried Safari AND Chrome and still no luck.
 
To see if updates are available for the app, open the App Store, tap your profile icon, then scroll down to see if updates are available. If updates aren't available for the app, update the software on your iPhone or iPad.
 
I downloaded Firefox on my Macbook Air M1 and the Xfinity Stream link didn't work for me. I tried loading it from a TV show link by Googling a random tv show (ie "Xfinity Stream Atlanta") and it still wouldn't load.

I tried again yesterday and this worked. On Safari, I went to Xfinity.com, to the home page. On the top bar, next to the cart there is a button with a user face, after pressing it, it shows a menu of items. At the bottom there is a choice of "Watch TV Online." After selecting that, the stream activated. You can log in to your account there.
 
I was finally able to access Xfinity stream from my Chrome browser on my 2020 Macbook Air M1. I went to site settings, privacy and security, cookies and other site data, and turned on "Clear cookies and site data when you close all windows." This is the only solution that has worked for now.
 
Try signing into the xfinity website first. Then click on "TV and Streaming" at the top of the screen. Find "Never miss a moment of your favorite shows and movies Watch online" towards the bottom of the screen and click on it. Finally, click on "Watch online" next to Download the app.
 
Try clicking the lock icon next to the xfinity.com/stream web address and then click on site setting and clear your usage data. Then refresh the page again and see if it lets you re log-in. This worked for my imac.
 
I was having similar issues logging in to the Xfinity site as well as using Xfinity apps such as Xfinity and Xfinity Stream. Also, apps such as Max that authenticate using my Xfinity provider login would simply hang at the oauth step. Tried everything and then finally rebooted my Cable modem and now I can login to my Xfinity apps and the website.
 
How do you "delete the website data connected to Xfinity prior to trying to "Watch TV Online???" I cannot watch it on my mac desktop on Safari, Firefox or Chrome. None of them work and nothing works. This is not an app. This is just watching online which I was once able to do. Then inexplicably it stopped working no matter what browser I used. Apple blames Xfinity. Xfinity blames Apple. If it doesn't work and it's not going to work, just tell people.
 
**Why is the Xumo Play app frozen?
**If the Xumo Play app is frozen on your screen, try exiting Xumo Play and then relaunching the app. Also, check your internet connection to see if other apps or services are having trouble streaming or launching.
 
**How do I get back to the main menu once I'm in the Xumo Play app on X1 or Flex?**
Press the **Exit**button on your remote. You can also press the **Guide** ****or **xfinity**buttons.
 
**Can I pause, rewind, and/or DVR Xumo Play channels?
**Functions such as pause and playback controls aren't available on the Live TV channels. You can only pause, rewind, and fast-forward while watching on-demand movies or TV shows.
 
**Why are there so many ads when I watch Xumo Play? Why do I see the same ad over and over again?
**Xumo Play is available to you for free because of the advertisements within the programs that you select to watch.

Yes, Xumo Play programming is delivered over your Xfinity Internet service; therefore, Xumo Play will be subject to the same rules, terms, and conditions that govern Xfinity Internet service, including any data usage plans that may apply.
 
**Why are some titles on the Xumo Play app on my Smart TV but not on X1?**
Xumo Play programming can differ slightly on various devices. The networks available through the Xumo Play app on X1 were carefully selected by Xumo Play and Xfinity for the enjoyment of X1 customers.
 
**Does Xumo Play have parental controls?**
Parental controls are not available on Xumo Play. X1 and Flex customers who want to enforce programming restrictions are encouraged to set an Application Lock for Xumo Play.

I have an Xfinity modem/router (model TG1682G) and just purchased a tri-band orbi to handle dead spots in the house. I researched and saw that most recommended to enable Bridge mode on my Xfinity modem so that Orbi is doing all of the routing. I did that, set up my Orbi, and my devices saw the new router. Problem is that I did not have an internet connection. I was on the phone with Comcast for 2 hours while they tried all kinds of things. Finally, they said they could not help because my modem was working properly and had a signal, so since I was using a 3rd party product, they could no longer help. I had to have them disable bridge mode to get internet back up. Does anyone have suggestions? Should I forego this method and keep the Xfinity up as a router and have the Orbi run off of it? In that case, I would more or less have 2 routers, correct? I am at a loss and don't what to do at this point. I also saw something about setting up Orbi as an Access Point. Confused at this point!! Thanks for any help!
 
If you were able to setup the Xfinity modem in bridge mode, then your Orbi should have picked up an IP address. This is a silly thing to ask, but did you check to make sure that your ethernet cable from the Xfinity modem was plugged into the yellow (WAN) port on the Orbi Router? Also, make sure you have Xfinity turn off the xfinity hotspot feature on the modem. You don't want the wireless signal from your modem interfering with the Orbi. Even in bridge mode, Xfinity keeps that feature on.
 
Yes, I was connected from the Xfinity modem (ethernet port 1, that's what port Comcast said I should use) and connected it to the yellow port on the Orbi. Do you have to have Xfinity turn off the hotspot feature? All of my devices could see the new Orbi router, but just no internet connection.
 
Strange that you weren't getting the internet to work with the modem in bridge mode. My only suggestion would be to try again, but this time don't power on the Orbi until the Xfinity modem finishes initializing in bridge mode. Once it is ready, turn on the Orbi and see if it connects.
 
I have an Xfinity modem in bridge mode, with the hotspot turned off. The reason I had it turned off was because it sits right next to the Orbi router. I did not want the radios to interfere with my Orbi network. So, unless you connect to Xfinity's hotspot at home, I don't see why you should keep it on. Do you have to turn it off? It is up to you, but it couldn't hurt.
 
Modem Combo Units:
Couple of options,
1. Configure the modem for transparent bridge mode. Then use the Orbi router in router mode.
2. If you can't bridge the modem, disable ALL wifi radios on the modem, configure the modems DMZ for the IP address the Orbi router gets from the modem. Then you can use the Orbi router in Router mode.
3. Or disable all wifi radios on the modem and connect the Orbi router to the modem, LAN to LAN and configure AP mode on the Orbi router.
 
I am totally at sea as to how to connect the Orbi to my Xfinity router. Right now I have the yellow ethernet cord connecting my desktop and my Xfinity router. I'm not sure how to connect from the Xfinity router to the Orbi router as this post says to do. There do not seem to be any extra outlets in the back of the Xfinity router which would permit connecting the Orbi to it. If I connect the ethernet cord from the Xfinity router to the Orbi, then it won't be connected to my desktop.
 
Nor am I sure how to change the Xfinity router settings so that it will be compatible with the Orbi. If there are any clear step by step instructions already published explaining how to do this, or someone can lay this out for me here I'd be grateful.
